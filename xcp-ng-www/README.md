# XCP-NG deploy page

Cause for some reason I can't push code into the xcp-ng repo, I created a new repo to test the deploy page.

The code of the page is here : https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp-ng-release/blob/8.2/src/xenserver/opt/xensource/www/XCP-ng-index.html

Branch 8.2 but will be change in the future

# The tools are in 2 parts :

- The [custom icon-font](icon-font/README.md) in `icon-font` folder made from differents sources
- The Cypress tests with mocks and documentation to test and run the page
